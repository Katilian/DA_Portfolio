Projects
Product Range Analysis  |  Dashboard  |  Download Project
In this project we perform a product range analysis on an online store invoice dataset.
We use several data analysis methods such as Machine learning (Association rules), Seasonality analysis, First transaction analysis and hypothesis testing.

Churn Prediction Machine Learning Analysis  |  Download Project
In this project we employ machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of churn for customers of a gym.
We will use both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, determine the best algorithm based on each algorithm's metrics and analyze the importance of each data feature to the chance of customer churn.

Business Analytics  |  Download Project
In this project we perform a cohort analysis on a ticket selling business data and calculate various business metrics such as LTV, CAC, ROI, and ROMI.
This will help us determine the success of the business as well as investigate which marketing campaign is producing the best return on investment and which ones we should immediately drop.

Analyzing and Evaluating AB Test Results  |  Download Project
In this project we analyze the results of an A/A/B test of a company that wanted to test a new font on their website.
We evaluate the results of the test and the reliability of the test conditions using CR funnel analysis and statistical hypothesis testing.

Evaluation of a Faulty AB Test  |  Download Project
In this project we perform an evaluation on two AB tests that were done under less than optimal conditions.
As such, in order to make sense of them, we employ rigorous EDA to determine if the tests are viable, and CR funnel analysis combined with statistical testing to determine if the results are meaningful.

AB Test Analysis and Business Decisions  |  Download Project
In this project we are asked to analyze the results of an A/B test in order to produce business recommendations.
We prioritize several hypotheses and test them against the results of the AB test, and combined with our explorative analysis we recommend a preferred course of action.

Youtube Trending Dashboard & Presentation  |  Download Presentation  |  Dashboard
In this project we take a look at the trending section of youtube, to determine the profile of videos that tend to receive the Trending tag in various sections of the globe.
We use Tableau to visualize our findings and make our case.
With the help of our conclusions we will be able to recommend the type of videos that have the most ad revenue potential for our marketing team!

LA Cafe Investment Analysis  |  Download Project  |  Presentation
In this project we analyze the market conditions of the restaurant scene in Los Angeles.
We will make a report to investors who are interested in our idea to open a cafe venue.
We look at trends of venues in popular streets of LA, charecteristics of chained and private establishments, seat capacity and more!

Video Games Sales Analysis  |  Download Project
In this project we analyze the sales of video games of various platforms such as PS, Xbox, Wii and many more.
We perform an explorative analysis on the dataset and employ data visualization and statistical hypothesis testing to determine the profile of a successful game.

Ride Sharing Frequency Analysis  |  Download Project
In this project we examine data from taxi and ride-sharing companies.
We'll determine passenger preferences, popular locales, and the effects of external factors.
Finally we will perform statistical analysis to determine the effects of weather on ride durations.

Telecom Plan Success Analysis  |  Download Project
In this project we compare two plans of a telecom company by their monthly revenue and user activity.
We use statistical testing to determine how the plans differ from one another on a monthly basis and decide which one is worth the marketing team's attention.

More to come soon!
